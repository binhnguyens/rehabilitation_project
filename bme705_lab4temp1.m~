%% Force plate Analysis
% This seciton should follow the first part of the analysysis from Lab 3
% you should obtain the COPnet from Winter et al. 2003 paper

% analyzeFP function: "Given" (do not edit): converst raw forceplate data
% INPUT = 16 channels of raw forceplate data;
% OUTPUT: xCOPL, yCOPL, xCOPR, yCOPR, Fz_R, Fz_L
% Note: Rv_R and Rv_L are vertical forces of right and left forceplate 
% Repeat for esEO_fp

%%% Calcualte the COPnet
% 1st: Define the global center of pressure coodinate & use these to compute COPnet
% Shift X-coordinates to the middle of the split force plate by +/- 12.5825cm

xCOPLnew2 = xCOPL2 - 12.5825;
xCOPRnew2 = xCOPR2 + 12.5825;

%% Calculate COP for overall system using Winter et al., 2003 [1]: 
% Equation 1 (same Equation 1 in the Lab 4 manual).

xCOP  = xCOPLnew .*(Rv_L)./(Rv_R+Rv_L)+ xCOPRnew.*(Rv_R)./(Rv_R+Rv_L);
yCOP  = yCOPL .* (Rv_L)./(Rv_R+Rv_L) + yCOPR.*(Rv_R)./(Rv_R+Rv_L);

xCOP2  = xCOPLnew2 .*(Rv_L2)./(Rv_R2+Rv_L2)+ xCOPRnew2.*(Rv_R2)./(Rv_R2+Rv_L2);
yCOP2 = yCOPL2 .* (Rv_L2)./(Rv_R2+Rv_L2) + yCOPR2.*(Rv_R2)./(Rv_R2+Rv_L2);

%% EMG Analysis
% This seciton should follow your analysis from Lab 1 to obtain 
% the "evnelope" of the EMG signals.
% Analyze both Sol. and TA muscles.

G=1000; % for "sway_data"; change G to match the gain from your experiment

% Convert units - express EMG in miliVolts (mV) 
x = (increase_ta_emg/g*1000);



% Define time
len = length (x);
t = [1:len]/f;



% Define Envelope filter - Low-pass filter, Butterworth, 4th order, fc=2.5Hz

n=4;
fc=2.5;
[b,a]=butter(n,fc/(f/2));

x_filt = filtfilt(b,a,x_reshape);
janna = rms (x_filt);


% Processing: 1) Rectify; 2) Envelope




%% Plotting the Data
% Considerer the timing of activation of the Sol. and TA muscles with
% respect to the COP sway in the AP direction.

% Define time
